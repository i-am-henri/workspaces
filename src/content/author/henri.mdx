## about me
I created this website at the age of 14, and it has been my main way of learning web development. There are much websites like this out there, but mostly for the design, and not the tool. So i created this website.

## how i created this website?
I used [astro](https://astro.build/) to create this website. I used the [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework to style and the [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) icons.
